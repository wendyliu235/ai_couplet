# AI-couplet-writer

Welcome! This is our fun project of using AI to write couplets (对对联). Please check out our website!

## Introduction
- What is couplet (对联)
  - Couplet is a two-liner poem with strict semantic and phoenetic rules
  - See the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antithetical_couplet) (English) page for more details

- What is this project for
  - The model will predict the second line (下联) given the first line (上联)
  - This project improves from similar ones (see Reference for their great work) on:
    - This is the first of its kind written in TensorFlow 2, to the best of our knowledge
    - This model improves from the reference models mostly on (i) emotional (意境) matching; (ii) repeated characters treatment (see the **Model** section below)

## Examples

|     Input     |     Output    |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 欲把心事付瑶琴  |  且将笔墨书诗画  |
| 半衾幽梦香初散  |  一曲清音韵未央  |
| 应是飞鸿踏泥雪  |  何如落雁归故乡  |
| 云破月来花弄影  |  雨停风送柳含烟  |
| 别后相思空一水  |  愁中寂寞又几回  |
| 书中自有黄金屋  |  笔下常留白玉簪  |
| 花谢花飞花满天  |  鸟啼鸟语鸟鸣春  |
| 杨柳岸晓风残月  |  芦苇春寒雨乱烟  |


## Model
This is a sequence-to-sequence model with Encoder + Decoder + Attention, schematically shown as below.

Notable features
- Embedding layer pretrained via Word2Vec
- Beam search decoder
- Format polishing to prevent repeated characters, etc.

## Data & How to Run
- Download the training data (~70k couplets) from [this](https://github.com/wb14123/couplet-dataset) repo
- Set up the model hyperparameters and the file paths in the **baseconfig.ini**
- Install the package dependencies
  - **TensorFlow 2.7.0**
  - Python 3.7.9
  - Numpy 1.19.5
  - Gensim 4.1.2
  - Scikit-Learn 0.24.2
- Train the model
  - Run as ```python train.py```
  - The model parameters will be written to the path set up in the config file
  - Our model on the website was trained on Google Colab Pro for 12 epochs (~1 day)
